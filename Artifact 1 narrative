## Narrative
I.	Software Engineering/Design

A.	Artifact

The artifact for my software engineering/design enhancement is my Zoo Authentication and Monitoring System that I did during my time in IT-145 Foundation in Application Development course in February of 2017.

B.	Justification

I picked this artifact because it was one of the most interesting programs, I worked on during my time in SNHU and in my program. Looking over the program I noticed that there wasnâ€™t much that could have changed the fact that it was a straightforward program. But as I looked more and more, I saw that there was a chance of making the main a bit cleaner with putting the algorithm for the MD5 hash in its own class and just linking it into the main class. 
This helps keeps the code cleaner and more organized. Instead of having the algorithm in the main it can have its own class to be able to work on the code if any improvements need to be made. It also leaves the main clutter free so you can actually see what the main does. This improves the code by just making it cleaner and more organized. It makes it really easy to read the code and follow it. 

C.	Objective Outcome

When it came to the planned enhancement, I was able to meet the course objectives and what I had planned to do for the code in the software design document plan. If time allows, I will try to implement a user console to the main to make it look a bit more pleasant than just a terminal console. After making the adjustments I was able to see that the main class already looked cleaner and more readable. Without having that algorithm in the class it really cleaned up the main class. Now when I got to make my enhancement for the second artifact, I will have a class that I can go into and make the changes right there without making any changes besides linking the two classes together. I would say the outcome was achieved and was happy with it. 

D.	Reflection

While enhancing the artifact I learned a very important lesson that I was taught before but noticed the importance of it now while working on this project. That important lesson is the importance of having clean and organized code. I really helped me having the algorithm in a separated class than being within the main. Now if I ever want to increase the security of the code all I need to do is upgrade the algorithm in its own class leaving the main all on its own. 
The challenges I faced and actually still facing is getting the program to run correctly with the new hash security in the algorithm. I am still in the process of debugging to see where it has gone wrong with running the program. Besides that it has been pretty straight forward with everything else.
