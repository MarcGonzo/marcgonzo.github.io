# **IT-145 Authentication System Artifact 3 Narrative**

## Code
This is the the MySQL code that I created to be able to showcase my abilities to store data in a database.

## Narrative
I.	Databases 

A.	Artifact

The artifact for my algorithms and data structures enhancement is also my Zoo Authentication and Monitoring System that I did during my time in IT-145 Foundation in Application Development course in February of 2017.

B.	Justification

I picked this artifact because it was one of the most interesting programs, I worked on during my time in SNHU and in my program. Looking over the program I noticed that there wasn’t much that could have changed the fact that it was a straightforward program. But as I looked more and more, I saw that there was a better way of storing the data of the program instead of having it in a text file. Therefore, I decided to create a database within MySQL. This allowed me to stretch my skills in creating a database from scratch and adding data into it. It refined my skills of being able to look up the language and be able to start using it after not using it for so long. Overall the artifact has improved to be able to house the data in a database. It is definitely more organized within a database than in a text file. 

C.	Objective Outcome

When it came to the planned enhancement, I was able to meet the course objectives and what I had planned to do for the code in the software design document plan in Module 1. I was able to make the enhancement I first planned on. By performing the CRUD process in MySQL to store the data better. There are no updates as of right now to my outcome-coverage plans to the original plan of each of the artifacts.   

D.	Reflection

While enhancing the artifact I learned a very important lesson that I was taught before but noticed the importance of it while working on this project. I learned the power of the internet and how it helps to refresh your memory of a language that I haven’t used in quite a while. I choose in the beginning to build out a database with MySQL to house the information of the artifact. This is something that I have not done in a long time. It challenged me to get it started and needed to look back on what the commands I needed to use to get the database started from scratch. But again, like I mentioned before the wonderful world of the internet really helped with looking up the language and being and to remember what I had learned in my MySQL class a while back in my program.
