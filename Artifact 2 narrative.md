## Narrative
I.	Algorithms & Data Structures

A.	Artifact

The artifact for my algorithms and data structures enhancement is also my Zoo Authentication and Monitoring System that I did during my time in IT-145 Foundation in Application Development course in February of 2017.

B.	Justification

I picked this artifact because it was one of the most interesting programs, I worked on during my time in SNHU and in my program. Looking over the program I noticed that there wasn’t much that could have changed the fact that it was a straightforward program. But as I looked more and more, I saw that there was a chance of making the program more secured.
I am going to do this by changing the algorithm from a MD5 to a SHA-512 hash. I started this change with working in the new class I had done for the SHA-512 algorithm. Once in that class I started building the algorithm. This showcased my ability to build out a more robust security to the program. It changed me because I wasn’t sure on how I was going to build it out and how to get it all working correctly. It helped me see when I am frustrated to take my time and see where the problems areas are and get them to work. At the end of it all the enhancement the program was improved, and the security of the program has increased with the hash being created with the algorithm for SHA-512. When comparing the hash from MD5 and SHA-512 the length of the SHA-512 hash is so much more than the MD5. I can see why it is a better hash to use for security. 

C.	Objective Outcome

When it came to the planned enhancement, I was able to meet the course objectives and what I had planned to do for the code in the software design document plan in module 1. I was able to make the enhancement I first planned on making the hash algorithm better to increase the security of the program. There are no updates as of right now to my outcome-coverage plans to the original plan of each of the artifacts.  

D.	Reflection

While enhancing the artifact I learned a very important lesson that I was taught before but noticed the importance of it now while working on this project. That important lesson is the importance of having clean and organized code. I really helped me having the algorithm in a separated class than being within the main. Making the changes I needed to make to enhance the algorithm within its own class made it very simple. I did not have to worry about making any changes to the main. I was able to leave it alone and work in my class I created for the algorithm. I learned the importance of making sure that you are using all the same variables in between classes. It is important for the variables to match so that the program will work correctly. 
The challenges I faced was debugging the program to see why it was not creating a hash according to the password that was being inputted by the user. I ran the debugger and was able to notice where the program was going wrong. I noticed that it wasn’t taking in the password that the user put in to verify it with the hash that was in the text file. I followed where it went wrong and made the correct changes for it to pull in the password and create the hash and verify it to the text file.
