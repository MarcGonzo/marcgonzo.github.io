# **Welcome to My Project!**

## Self Assessment

When I came into Southern New Hampshire University, I first started in the IT program thinking I will just advance the skills I already have. But with one conversation with my advisor we decided to challenge myself a little and I switched to the Computer Science program in SNHU. I say I wanted to challenge myself because I have never done anything within the Computer Science field. This was the first time I was ever exposed to writing software. Man was it a challenge, throughout the CS program I was tasked to write programs in different languages that I have never seen before. Not only was I writing in different languages I was also learning different computer science disciplines, how to collaborate with a development team, and the life cycle of a program. 

My time in the CS program there were classes that I had difficulty in. But being able to reach out to classmates and working within a team helped me overcome the hardship I was having within the class. One example was a Graphic design class that I needed to code an object and add lights axles within OpenGL. This class was one that I differently work in a group to talk things out and figure roadblocks out.

Through CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle, I learned about a methodology of development that stuck with me and really helped me understand the life cycle of a program. Also, a great take away from that class was the way that a development team can share its advances to stakeholders of the company I work at. After this class I felt great about joining a development team that used the Agile Method of development. 

Classes that helped my skills in data structures, algorithms, software engineering, and security was, IT-140 Introduction to Scripting, IT-145 Foundation in Application Development, CS-260 Data Structures and Algorithms, and lastly CS-340 Client/Server Development. All of these classes and terms introduced me to programing concepts that I never worked on. The enhancements of my artifacts were all done to my project I did in IT-145. But that was the only class that I learned about Data Structures and Algorithms. CS-260 really helped with understand and improving my skill when it came to storing data and using algorithms to get the data we needed. 

There a few classes that I learned about databases and the CRUD process. Which is create, read, update and delete entries in a database. DAD-220 Introduction to SQL was where I was able to learn the basics of MySQL and how manipulate tables. I created tables and added entries to those tables and ran queries on those tables as well to get the data I needed. From DAD-220, I took CS-340 Client/Server Development where I learned NoSQL and MongoDB. In this class we were to create a database in MongoDB on a server and create a RESTful API to manipulate that database. The skills I learned in DAD-220 was what I used to enhance my artifact in my ePortfolio. 

Within my ePortfolio I have enhanced an Authorization and Authentication program for all three artifacts. The skills that it showcases are my abilities in software engineering & design as well as algorithms & data structures. I performed these skills by taking a well working program and polished it to a higher standard. I was able to clean up the main function and separated methods into their own classes. Now the programing flows better and can be followed and understood better. 

My other skills that my ePortfolio showcases is my abilities in database construction and maintenance. The data that the program needs to function with I was able to create and store in a database using MySQL commands. Then I was able to show the maintenance of a database by using the CRUD commands to show a real-life scenario when someone would do work in a database.
